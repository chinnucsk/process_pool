process_pool
=========

written by [michael lowell roberts][fmrl].

overview
--------

**process_pool** is a supervision tree module that can dynamically create children. unlike a *simple_one_for_one* supervisor, however, *process_pool* permits access to its children through client-specified names.

i am still developing *process_pool*, so please consider the API unstable for the moment.
